# Gatsby Starter - WordPress Twenty Twenty

A port of the WordPress Twenty Twenty theme to Gatsby. 

---

This starter uses **Gatsby V3** and the new `gatsby-source-wordpress@v5`. You can find documentation for that package [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-wordpress/).

Checkout some options of the source plugin: [plugin-options.md](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress/docs/plugin-options.md)

## Plugin Versions

Last tested with the following plugin versions.

- WPGraphQL: 1.3.5
- WPGatsby: 1.0.8
- gatsby-source-wordpress: 5.5.0
- gatsby-plugin-image: 1.5.0

## WordPress Setup

1. Make sure to install the two required WP plugins [wp-gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/wp-gatsby) and [wp-graphql](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql)
2. Best you install and activate the default WordPress Twenty Twenty theme
3. Make sure you have Menus with the following slugs [You must add each menu to a location](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/83f140e4caf166cf094ed2083514078bc232a123/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress/docs/tutorials/using-wordpress-menus.md#menus-and-menu-items-in-wpgraphql): 
   -  `primary` - Thats the top menu
   -  `extended` - That is the menu that opens on the right side as drawer
   -  `social-links-menu` - For the Social menu in the footer and in the expanded drawer
      -  For the social Icons you need to adjust `SocialMenu.js`. There is a `SocialIcon` function that parses svgs depending on the Link label
4. Rename `.env.example` file to `.env` and edit it with your domain variables. Make sure to fill all variables properly.
   - `WPGRAPHQL_URL` - Your GraphQL endpoint
   - `SITE_URL` - Your frontend domain (without ending slash) to stitch together SEO relevant image urls.
